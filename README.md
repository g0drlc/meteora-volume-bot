# Meteora Volume Bot

The **Meteora Volume Bot** is designed to automate the distribution of SOL to multiple wallets and perform endless buy and sell swap transactions on the **Meteora platform**. This bot is built to enhance trading efficiency by leveraging **Solana's blockchain technology**. It aims to generate more **buy pressure** and increase the number of pool makers.

## Key Features

- **Automated SOL Distribution**: Distributes SOL to new wallets automatically, ensuring the volume doesn't concentrate on a single wallet.
- **Endless Buy and Sell Swaps**: Executes simultaneous buy and sell transactions to increase activity on the pool.
- **Swap with Jupiter V6**: Utilizes the **Jupiter V6 swap aggregator** for optimized trading performance.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Easily customizable settings for buy amounts, intervals, and distribution parameters.

## What's New in the Updated Version?

### Issues with the Previous Version:
- **Repetitive Buy and Sell in One Wallet**: Previous versions reused fixed wallets, which made it obvious on DexScreener that one wallet was constantly performing repetitive trades.
- **No Increase in the Number of Makers**: The old version only increased volume without creating additional pool makers.
- **Tokens Gathered Instead of SOL**: Tokens were gathered without being sold off before collection.
- **Equal Buys and Sells**: The previous approach caused sell pressure, as buys and sells were equal, leaving a sell action at the end.

### Improvements in the Updated Version:
- **New Wallet for Every Round**: After each buy and sell operation, the bot transfers SOL to a newly created wallet, generating more decentralized activity.
- **Increased Pool Makers**: Each new round creates additional wallets, increasing the number of makers in the pool.
- **Sell Before Gathering**: The bot sells any leftover tokens in the wallet before gathering SOL, maximizing efficiency and reclaiming token account rent.
- **More Buys Than Sells**: To create more **buy pressure**, the bot buys twice as much as it sells, ensuring stronger market demand.
